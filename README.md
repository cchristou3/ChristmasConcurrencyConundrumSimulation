# CO3401 Advanced Software Engineering Techniques â€“ Coursework (Part 1)

## Title: Java Simulation of a Christmassy Concurrency Conundrum

This repository contains the written answers to the questions in the Coursework (Part 1) of the CO3401 Advanced Software Engineering Techniques module. The questions and detailed answers are provided below.

## Main Program Structure

The main program outlined structure is as follows:

1. **Read from a Configuration File:**
   - Read from a configuration file to create the configuration of Hoppers, Belts, Turntables, and Sacks.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize the system by filling the hoppers with Presents according to the configuration file.
   - Call the run methods on the threaded objects to start the simulation.

3. **Simulation:**
   - Run the simulation for the specified duration.
   - Output reports every 10 seconds to monitor the system's progress.
   - At the appropriate time, instigate the shutdown of the machine.

4. **Output Final Report:**
   - After the simulation completes, output the final report summarizing the system's performance.

## Question 1

### Hopper
[Insert Hopper's operation description here]

### Turntable
[Insert Turntable's operation description here]

### Stopping all the threads and finishing gracefully at the end of the simulation
[Insert description of how the simulation is stopped and threads are shut down]

### Simulation Continuation
[Explain how the system continues working until no more presents are left]

## Question 2

### Deadlock
[Explain what a deadlock is and why it does not occur in the current system]

### Livelock
[Explain what a livelock is and why it does not occur in the current system]

## Console Output and Scenarios
[Explain that the repository includes console output from different scenarios demonstrating the behavior of the system]
